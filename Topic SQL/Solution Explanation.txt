Create a primary key and the following constraints for a Class and Student table in MySQL. Insert the values from the following tables into the newly formed table. The number of students in each part can be determined using the count function, and the student marks more than or equal to 75 can be calculated using the where condition. Finally, use the group by function to organise the students' grades depending on the sections.
